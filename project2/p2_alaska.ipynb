Another view of the data would be to visualize the precipitation value at each point. We make use of the GMT package's bar3 function to create a 3D plot of the precipitation recorded at each location. Before being able to call the function, however, we need to section up Alaska into a series of bins. Imagine placing a checkerboard over the above graph. Each square in the checkerboard will have a (lon,lat) pair associated with it. Each measurement will be placed in the square that it's closest to. We will take an average if there are squares that have more than one measurement associated with it. The pixelate function below helps us with taking our data, and turning it into the grid we described. Note, you only need to understand the inputs and outputs to the function, not all of the code. "
